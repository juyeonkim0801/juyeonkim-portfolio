                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Climate change brings extreme weather hazards like wildfires, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and more. These hazards not only affect residents in local areas but also impact tourists‚Äô travel schedules. Tourists are usually new to the areas and are not aware of how to navigate such hazards.
                    <span class="highlight">Yet, there are no useful tools to help tourists plan their trip in conjunction with weather hazards.</span>

            <div class="prj-body">
                <p>As a team, we utilized a lean canvas to brainstorm the business scenario and user needs to solve this problem. It also includes a competitive analysis. After several discussions, we decided to make a <span class="highlight">mobile app</span>
            because it makes it easier for tourists to access weather information. <br>
            We also narrowed down the app‚Äôs features: <br><br>
                (1) <span class="highlight">Show the predicted climate emergency</span> of the user‚Äôs trip at a selected location in a time frame <br>
                (2) <span class="highlight">Recommend nearby spots</span> that are safe to travel to <br>
                (3) <span class="highlight">Log</span> the trip results <br>
                (4) <span class="highlight">Educate</span> our users on climate change and how to tackle it</p><br>
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                We utilized <span class="highlight">literature search</span> as our background research method.
                Through this traditional yet effective method, we collected data about climate change.
                We gained insights about ranking of causes that contribute most to climate change,
                news articles about climate change and tourism, government data about climate change, and a world map about global warming.
                <br><br><h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                &#x2022; Climate change harms tourism in many ways.<br>
                &#x2022; Global warming lengthens the period of summer that is unpleasantly hot in beach resort regions.<br>
                &#x2022; Global warming shortens ski seasons in mountain retreats.<br>
                &#x2022; Increasing water scarcity in warmer regions becomes a potential for conflict between locals and the resource-intensive tourism industry.<br>
                &#x2022; Wildfire is one of the most common natural disasters caused by climate change, and it affects tourists more directly than other disasters.<br>

                <p>Our group conducted a usability testing session with another classmate who was really into traveling. During our in-person meeting at Starbucks, our team assigned him three tasks:
                    <br><br>(1) Look up Irvine and find the weather hazard during a time frame
                    <br>(2) If the weather hazard is severe in the area, look for nearby place to travel
                    <br>(3) Find and read climate change news<br><br>
                    Overall, the user found it easy to complete the tasks, without much hesitation. The user said the app flow was intuitive enough for him to locate major functionalities. Yet, he pointed out that the ‚ÄúCall 911 for help‚Äù functionality does not seem necessary as the app is about planning the trip beforehand rather than evacuating a dangerous area. For that reason, we decided to remove the feature in our high-fidelity prototype.

                    We incorporated colors and elements that represent weather to set up our design system.
                    For example, I mixed common symbols that represent location and weather to design the logo, by adding a sky blue ring and yellow dots to a map marker to characterize clouds and the sun.
