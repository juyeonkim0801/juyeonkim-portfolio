                <p>Climate change brings extreme weather hazards like wildfires, hurricanes, thunderstorms, and more. These hazards not only affect residents in local areas but also impact touristsâ€™ travel schedules. Tourists are usually new to the areas and are not aware of how to navigate such hazards.
                    <span class="highlight">Yet, there are no useful tools to help tourists plan their trip in conjunction with weather hazards.</span>
